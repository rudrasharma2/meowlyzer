# Meowlyzer Help & Support

Welcome to the **Meowlyzer** support page! We are here to help you and your feline friend build a deeper bond through the power of AI.

### 📚 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How does the Video Translator work?**
A: Unlike other apps that only listen to sounds, Meowlyzer analyzes your cat's body language, facial expressions, and meows simultaneously. Simply record a 5-10 second video and our AI will translate it into human language.

**Q: Why does the app need Camera and Microphone access?**
A: We need the camera to analyze your cat's behavior for the "Video Translator" and "Rate My Cat" features. The microphone is used to hear and decode their meows.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes! We do not require accounts or logins. Your videos and audio are processed in real-time via the Gemini AI API and are not stored on our servers. See our [Privacy Policy](LINK_TO_YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY) for more details.

**Q: Why did the translation fail?**
A: Ensure your cat is clearly visible in the video and that there isn't too much background noise. The AI works best when it can see the cat's face and tail movements!

**Q: Does Meowlyzer provide medical advice?**
A: **No.** While our AI Petcare assistant provides helpful tips, Meowlyzer is for **entertainment purposes only**. For any health, dietary, or medical concerns, please consult a professional veterinarian.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing issues, please try the following:
1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure Camera and Microphone permissions are enabled in your device settings.
2. **Internet Connection**: Meowlyzer requires an active internet connection to process AI translations.
3. **Update App**: Ensure you are running the latest version of Meowlyzer from the App Store.
