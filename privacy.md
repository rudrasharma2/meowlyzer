# Privacy Policy for Meowlyzer

**Last Updated: February 23, 2026**

Meowlyzer ("we," "our," or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Meowlyzer mobile application (the "App").

### 1. No User Accounts
Meowlyzer does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share your name. You can use all features of the App anonymously. We do not store any personal identifiers that link your identity to your device.

### 2. Data Collection and Usage
To provide our core features, the App must process certain types of data. This data is used solely for **App Functionality** and is not used for tracking or advertising.

*   **Photos and Videos**: When you use the "Rate My Cat" or "Video Translator" features, the video you record is transmitted to a secure third-party server (Google Gemini API) for real-time analysis.
*   **Audio Data**: When you record your cat's meows, the audio is transmitted to a secure third-party server for sound-to-text translation.
*   **Other User Content**: Any text questions you type into the "Petcare AI Chat" are transmitted to a secure third-party server to generate an AI response.

### 3. Third-Party Service Providers
Meowlyzer utilizes the **Google Gemini API** (Generative AI) to process video, audio, and text data. 
*   **Data Processing**: Data is transmitted to Google's servers solely to perform the requested analysis or translation.
*   **Anonymity**: No personal identifiers (like your name or device ID) are sent to Google alongside this content.
*   **Service Level**: We encourage you to review [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and terms regarding Generative AI services.

### 4. Data Retention
We do **not** store your videos, audio recordings, or chat history on our own servers. Data is processed in real-time. Once the AI analysis is complete and the result is displayed on your device, the transmission session ends.

### 5. No Data Selling or Tracking
*   We **never** sell your data to third parties.
*   We **never** share your data with data brokers.
*   We **do not** use your data for targeted advertising or cross-app tracking.

### 6. Permissions
The App will request access to your:
*   **Camera**: To record videos for translation and rating.
*   **Microphone**: To record cat sounds for translation.
*   **Photo Library**: If you choose to upload an existing video from your gallery.
You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings.

### 7. Children's Privacy
Our App is safe for all ages, but we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not require accounts, we do not store any identifying information about any user.

### 8. Legal Disclaimers
**Entertainment Purposes Only**: Meowlyzer is intended for entertainment and educational purposes. The translations and ratings provided are generated by AI models and should not be used as a basis for medical, diagnostic, or professional veterinarian decisions. Always consult a qualified veterinarian regarding your pet's health.
